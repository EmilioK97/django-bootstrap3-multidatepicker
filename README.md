# django-bootstrap3-datepicker
Datepicker that also supports the selection of multiple dates for Django, using Bootstrap Twitter

The aim of this package is to provide widgets and form fields for Django that use
[bootstrap-datepicker](http://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

There are some packages that already try to do this, however I've never found one with working
multidate support.

# Notice
I've just started working on this package, so there's just chaos yet!
