# django-bootstrap3-datepicker
Datepicker that supports the selection of multiple dates for Django, using Bootstrap Twitter.

The aim of this package is to provide widgets and form fields for Django that use
[bootstrap-datepicker](http://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

There are some packages that already try to do this, however I've never found one with working
multidate support.

I'll slightly follow the package as provide [here](https://github.com/nkunihiko/django-bootstrap3-datetimepicker).
This package supports single date selection, mine will cover multidate selection.
Because that's not so much change I'll actually copy a lot from this code base.

# Notice
I've just started working on this package, so there's just chaos yet!

# Credits
I've used some libraries and I wish to thank the people who wrote them!
- Of course the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) developers
- [bootstrap3_datepicker](http://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
- [JavaScript Date Format](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format)

And all the people I've just forgotten ;).
